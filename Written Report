This anlysis gathers informations from 9170 students across 15 schools.
It compares average reading and math test scores for these students in regard to schhool udget and type.
8 of the schools anlyzed were charter school while 7 were dsitrict or public schools.
The purpose of this anlysis is to show inequties in school types using student test scores and comparing them with the schools budget, size and type of school

The results of this anlysis indicate that Large schools(population of 2000-5000)  have a lower overall passing rate(58%) than small schools(population <1000) which have a passing rate of 89%. 
This makes sense as smaller schools will have less students per teacher than large schools. So indiividual studenets receive more attention

The other notable analysis is that charter schools have a passing rate of 90% while district schools have a passing rate of only 53%

This data is not  suprising. small charter schools with more funding have a more succesfull student body while large distric schools have a substantially lower passing rate because of the large student body and the fact that they are publicly funded.
